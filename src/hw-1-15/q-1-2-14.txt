A physics student gets unexpected results when using the code

force = G * mass1 * mass2 / radius * radius

to compute values according to the formula F = G m_1 m_2 / r^2. Explain the problem and correct the code.

" When arithmetic operators have the same precedence, they are left associative "

so the value of G * m1 * m2 are being divided by radius and then multiplied again. Rather, it should be divided by radius squared.



force = (G * mass1 * mass2) / (radius * radius)
                                radius ** 2
